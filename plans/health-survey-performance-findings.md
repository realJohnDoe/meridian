# PWA Snappiness Survey — Meridian

## 1. Snappiness verdict

The app is well-tuned on the flows the code was clearly optimized for — **toggling a task and switching views are genuinely snappy** (no main-thread task over 50 ms even at 300 files), thanks to the expansion-cache overlay and optimistic checkbox state. But it falls off a cliff the moment a flow touches the **`roots` map or the backlink lookup**, because both do whole-vault work with coarse invalidation. The **worst flow by far is search**: a single keystroke ("e") froze the main thread for **7.1 seconds** on a 300-file vault, because the results list computes an **O(files²)** backlink lookup for _every_ matching file, does it _twice_ (both the mobile and desktop overlays mount and render), and mounts ~600 un-virtualized cards. The **second-worst is editing metadata** (title/tags/scope): each save creates a new `roots` Map, which invalidates the expansion cache and forces a full re-expansion of all 8,680 occurrences — a **377 ms** freeze per edit. The single biggest structural theme: **backlink resolution and occurrence expansion are recomputed wholesale, keyed on `roots` _identity_ rather than on what actually changed**, so a keystroke, a title edit, or a fresh mount each redo O(files²)/O(all-occurrences) work synchronously.

## 2. Coverage statement

**Test vault:** 300 files / 878 wikilink-items / **8,680 expanded occurrences** over the agenda's −365…+90 day window (15% weekly-recurring series, 40% dated tasks, 25% one-off events, 10% undated backlog, 10% notes). Generated deterministically (seeded mulberry32). Generator preserved at `scratchpad/testVaultGen.ts`. **Reproduce:** drop it in `src/storage/`, add to `exampleBackend.ts`:

```js
const ENTRIES =
  Number(localStorage.meridian_bigvault) > 0
    ? generateBigVault(Number(localStorage.meridian_bigvault))
    : buildEntries();
```

then set `localStorage.meridian_bigvault = "300"` and load the Tutorial vault.

| --------------------------------- | ------ | ---------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| 1. Toggle task                    | ✅     | ✅ live (0 long tasks)                   | **Fast** — optimistic paint + memoized rows         |

**Refuted — editor keystroke (flow 7):** the wikilink plugin rebuilds decorations over the _whole_ doc per keystroke (`parseWikilinks(doc.toString())` + a `for (let i = 1; i <= doc.lines; i++)` loop, not viewport-limited, in `src/editor/cm/wikilinkDecorations.ts:92`). At realistic note sizes this is cheap: `resolveWikilink` measured at ~0.01 ms/call, so even a 20-link note costs <1 ms/keystroke. I could not drive the CM editor live (every full-page navigation in this harness bounced to `/`, and card clicks didn't open the editor), so this is **unverified at pathological note sizes** (a 500-line note with 100+ links would re-scan everything each keystroke).

**Not measured / sampled:** GitHub sync path, IndexedDB cache writes (confirmed off the paint path — persistence is async via `writeEntity`), Day/Month view internals beyond the switch measurement, onboarding tour.

## 3. Findings

Ranked by `(impact × breadth) ÷ effort`.

> **Update 2026-07-14 — Finding 2 (backlink index) is FIXED** (commit `a6f6e4f`, "Replace O(files²·items) backlinksTo with a derived backlink index"). `buildBacklinkIndex` now builds a whole-vault reverse-link map once per `roots` change (O(roots·items)), stored on the Zustand store; all call sites do an O(1) `backlinks.get(slug)` lookup instead of the old per-target quadratic `backlinksTo`. This invalidates most of Finding 1 and slightly reduces Finding 3 — both re-evaluated inline below.

### Finding 1 — Search mounts the full result set un-virtualized, with no debounce

> **Re-evaluated 2026-07-14 after Finding 2 landed.** Two of this finding's three original causes are now gone: the per-match quadratic `backlinksTo` (~2,131 ms of the "e" long task) is replaced by an O(1) `backlinks.get`, and the "rendered twice" duplicate-overlay cost was removed by a refactor to a single `SearchOverlay` that branches on `isMobile` (only one `SearchResults` mounts). The original **7,105 ms / 608-card** baseline no longer holds. What survives is below.

- **Flows affected:** 3 (Search) — **every keystroke** while the search bar is open.
- **Category:** `search-latency` `render-amplification`
- **Impact:** **6** (was 10) — down from a multi-second freeze to an estimated ~1 s, dominated by the un-virtualized card mount. Still an everyday path.
- **Baseline measurement:** _Historical (survey time):_ typing **"e"** (299 of 300 files match) produced a single **7,105 ms** `longtask` and mounted **608** cards (≈299 × 2 overlays + agenda). _Current:_ the ~2,131 ms/keystroke `backlinksTo` cost and one of the two overlays are eliminated; remaining cost is a single un-virtualized mount of ~299 `OccurrenceCard`s plus no-debounce re-runs. **Not yet re-measured live** — estimated ~1 s, but should be re-driven on the big vault to confirm.
- **Measurement recipe:** load big vault → click search input → install `new PerformanceObserver(l => …).observe({entryTypes:['longtask']})` → clear `window.__longtasks` → set input value to `"e"` via the native setter + dispatch `input` → after 2.5 s read `window.__longtasks` and `document.querySelectorAll('[data-tour="entry-card"]').length` (expect ~299 now, not 608).
- **Breadth:** 3 files (`src/search/FileResultsList.tsx`, `src/search/SearchOverlay.tsx`, `src/components/SearchBar.tsx`). The former `FilterOverlay`/`MobileSearchOverlay` split is gone.
- **Fix effort:** S–M (backlink-index and single-overlay work already done; only debounce + virtualization remain)
- **Evidence:** `src/search/FileResultsList.tsx:46` — un-virtualized `results.map` over every match:
  ```jsx
  {results.map(({ entry, listedOn }, i) => { … <OccurrenceCard … /> … })}
  ```
  and `src/components/SearchBar.tsx:22` — still no debounce (`setQuery` fires on every `onChange`):
  ```js
  function setQuery(value: string) { void navigate({ … sq: value … , replace: true }) }
  ```
  Note the backlink lookup at `FileResultsList.tsx:38` is now the O(1) index read — no longer a cost.
- **Problem:** Every keystroke re-filters all files (cheap) then mounts hundreds of un-virtualized cards; with no debounce this repeats on each `onChange`, so the first letter typed still visibly hitches.
- **Fix:** Debounce the query (~150 ms) and virtualize the results list (as the agenda already is). Expected effect: per-keystroke long task **~1 s → <50 ms**.

### Finding 3 — Any metadata edit invalidates the expansion cache → full 8,680-occurrence re-expansion

- **Flows affected:** 5 (change date/scope/title/tags/repeat), 4 (create), 6 (cold start does the first expansion) — **every edit save**.
- **Category:** `critical-path-work` `data-and-persistence`
- **Impact:** **6** — a ~0.4 s freeze on a daily-but-not-constant action; the toggle path avoids it, edits don't.
- **Baseline measurement:** A single `roots`-identity change (what editing one title does) produced a **377 ms** long task. Isolated: full `expandWithMultiday` over the −365…+90 window = **111 ms median** (300 files → **8,680 occurrences**), plus `dedupeAndSort` of all 8,680 + regrouping + visible rows re-running `backlinksTo` (roots identity changed). By contrast, `toggleDone` keeps `roots` referentially stable, hits the cache overlay, and measured **0 long tasks**.
- **Measurement recipe:** `st.setData({items: st.items.slice(), roots: newMapWithOneTitleChanged})` with a longtask observer installed → read the resulting long task (377 ms). Expansion isolation: exposed `expandWithMultiday`, ran it 6×, took the median (111 ms) and `.length` (8,680).
- **Breadth:** `src/model/expansionCache.ts` + `src/model/storeOps.ts` `updateRoot` (every edit scope routes file-level fields through it) — affects all of `applyAll`/`applySingle`/`applyFuture`/`applyAdd`/`applyNew`.
- **Fix effort:** M–L
- **Evidence:** `src/model/expansionCache.ts:84` — the fast path requires `roots` reference-equality:
  ```js
  if (prev && prev.fromMs === fromMs && prev.toMs === toMs && prev.weekStart === weekStart && prev.roots === roots && hasSameStructure(prev.items, items)) {
  ```
  and `src/model/storeOps.ts:171` — `updateRoot` allocates a fresh map on every edit:
  ```js
  function updateRoot(roots: Roots, fileSlug: string, f: EditFields): Roots { const next = new Map(roots) }
  ```
- **Note (2026-07-14):** the mechanism is independent of the Finding 2 fix — `expandWithMultiday` (the ~111 ms dominant cost) has nothing to do with backlinks, so this finding stands. Two second-order adjustments: (a) the "visible rows re-run `backlinksTo`" portion of the 377 ms is now cheaper (rows do an O(1) `backlinks.get`), so the real freeze is likely **somewhat under 377 ms** now; (b) slightly offsetting, a `roots`-identity change now also triggers one `buildBacklinkIndex` rebuild (`src/store.ts:144`, O(roots·items), ~one pass over ~878 items) on this same save path — small, but new whole-vault work. Net effect on the number is roughly a wash; re-measurement would refine it.
- **Problem:** File-level fields (title/tags/items/body) live in `roots`; because the expansion cache keys on `roots` _identity_, changing any of them on one file discards the cached expansion for _all_ files and re-expands every series, blocking the save for ~0.4 s.
- **Fix:** Gate the cache on structural inputs only (the `items` structure already has `hasSameStructure`; `roots` only feeds `joinFileMeta`'s title/tags), and overlay changed file-level fields onto cached occurrences the same way `done`/`priority` are overlaid today — or expand from `items` and join `roots` fields at render. Expected effect: edit long task **377 ms → <20 ms**.

### Finding 4 — 298 kB gzip `components` chunk on the agenda's cold-start critical path

- **Flows affected:** 6 (cold start / PWA launch) — **once per launch**.
- **Category:** `bundle-and-startup`
- **Impact:** **4** — seconds only on slow networks; on localhost the parse/exec floor is small, but the transfer dominates real first-load.
- **Baseline measurement:** Production build ships **547 kB gzip / 1,710 kB decoded** of JS+CSS on the first agenda load. Largest chunk `components-*.js` = **298 kB gzip / 870 kB decoded**, larger than `main` (433 kB decoded) + `model` (148 kB) combined, and it's on the agenda's critical path (the agenda's `OccurrenceCard` + `_app`'s `SearchBar`/`Sidebar` all live there). `SearchBar` eagerly mounts `MobileSearchOverlay` (the `vaul` drawer) even on desktop.
- **Measurement recipe:** `pnpm run build` chunk table; then `vite preview` + `performance.getEntriesByType('resource')` summed `transferSize`/`decodedBodySize`, filtered to `.js`/`.css`.
- **Breadth:** `src/components/index.ts` barrel + its transitive `vaul`/`cmdk`/`radix`/`sonner` deps; build output (`grep -c vaul` on the built chunk: 118 occurrences).
- **Fix effort:** M
- **Evidence:** build output `dist/assets/components-Cbq1nBfP.js  891.08 kB │ gzip: 298.01 kB`; `src/components/SearchBar.tsx:48` mounts the mobile drawer unconditionally:
  ```jsx
  <MobileSearchOverlay open={searchOpen} … />
  ```
- **Problem:** The initial calendar paint downloads and parses the mobile search drawer, command-palette (`cmdk`), and dialog primitives it doesn't need yet, inflating time-to-interactive on first launch.
- **Fix:** Lazy-load `MobileSearchOverlay`/`FilterOverlay` behind the search-open state and split the settings/vault-wizard dialogs out of the eager barrel. Expected effect: agenda critical-path JS **~298 kB gzip → est. ~200 kB gzip**.

---

**Net (updated 2026-07-14):** Finding 2 (backlink index) is **done** — that alone removed ~4.2 s from search (the per-match quadratic `backlinksTo`, which also ran in the now-collapsed second overlay) and ~115 ms from every mount. What's left of the original "recompute whole-vault work on every `roots` touch" theme:

- **Finding 1** is now just debounce + virtualize on the search results (single overlay already done) — estimated ~1 s → <50 ms.
- **Finding 3** (expansion cache keyed on `roots` identity → full 8,680-occurrence re-expansion per edit) is untouched by the backlink fix and remains the ~0.4 s edit-freeze lever.
- **Finding 4** (bundle) is unaffected.
